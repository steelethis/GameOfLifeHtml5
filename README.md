What is this?
=============
This is Conway's Game of Life, written in HTML5/ES6.

The only dependency I have in this is require.js, and that's only for code organization.

The rest is pure javascript, no jquery or any other library pulled in.

It also uses ES6 classes.

How do I use it?
================
You can just download the zipped version of it and run "GameOfLife.html" in your browser!  You don't need to do anything special to run this. It runs in any modern browser (Edge, Firefox, Chrome).  It probably won't work in IE, or older versions of those other browsers since it uses newer ES6 features.

Why didn't you use Babel/Typescript/some other transpiler?
===========================================================
I didn't want the extra burden of dealing with a transpiler, and various other frameworks. This was an exercise in putting my Javascript skills to work.

I used ESLint with a slightly modified AirBnB styleguide to keep myself in line, which taught me a lot about how JS is written these days.
